    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Ajiaco, a beloved Colombian soup, is a celebration of hearty flavors. Combining three 
        varieties of potatoes, chicken, and corn simmered with guascas, the broth achieves a rich
        and distinctive taste. Garnished with avocado, capers, and a dollop of sour cream, ajiaco
        is a comforting dish that embodies the warmth and richness of Colombian culinary heritage,
        creating a delightful experience for those who come together to enjoy.
        <br> </br>
        In preparing ajiaco, the simmering process melds the flavors of the ingredients, and the
        final touch involves artfully garnishing each bowl. The result is a visually appealing and 
        flavor-packed soup that not only satisfies the palate but also brings people closer through 
        a shared appreciation for the cultural essence of Colombian cuisine.
