    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Birria is a Mexican culinary delight, renowned for its savory and aromatic profile. Typically
        made with slow-cooked, tender meat—commonly beef or goat—the dish is infused with a rich blend
        of spices, chilies, and herbs. What sets birria apart is its vibrant red broth, a result of 
        the meticulous cooking process that transforms simple ingredients into a flavorful symphony, 
        making it a beloved staple in Mexican cuisine.
        <br> </br>
        Originating from the state of Jalisco, birria has transcended regional boundaries, earning global
        acclaim. Whether enjoyed as a stew or in tacos, its succulent and spiced meat, coupled with the
        warming broth, creates a gastronomic experience that captivates taste buds and embodies the 
        essence of Mexican comfort food.
